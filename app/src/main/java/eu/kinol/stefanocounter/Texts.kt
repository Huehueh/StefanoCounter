        weeks[3] = "Fertilization: A sperm and egg join and create a zygote."
        weeks[4] = "The tiny bundle of cells turns into a blastocyst and implants into your uterine lining. The beginning of what will become the placenta forms. A water-tight sac forms around the blastocyst. This is the amniotic sac, and it provides cushioning to a fetus during pregnancy."
        weeks[5] = "The neural tube (brain, spinal cord and other neural tissue of the central nervous system) forms. The tiny “heart” tube will pulse 110 times a minute by the end of the fifth week."
        weeks[6] = "Tiny buds that become arms and legs also develop. Blood cells are taking shape, and circulation will begin. Structures that’ll become the ears, eyes and mouth take form. Your healthcare provider can probably detect pulses in the cluster of cells that will form the heart on a vaginal ultrasound."
        weeks[7] = "Bones begin replacing soft cartilage and genitals begin to form. The embryo’s head is large in proportion to the rest of its body. Some people think the embryo resembles a small tadpole or seahorse due to its prominent tail (which becomes legs) and large head."
        weeks[8] = "All of the major organs and body systems are developing. The embryo has web-like hands and feet. Eyes become visible and ears begin to form. The umbilical cord is fully developed and helps to transport oxygen and blood to the embryo."
        weeks[9] = "The beginnings of teeth and taste buds are forming. Its muscles are forming and its body shape takes on more of a human appearance. But, its head is still 50% of its length. Your provider may be able to hear its heartbeat with a Doppler ultrasound."
        weeks[10] = "The arms, hands, fingers, feet and toes are fully formed (no more webbed fingers). Fingernails and toenails are beginning to develop and the external ears form. The external genitals also begin to form, but it’s too soon to see them on an ultrasound."
        weeks[11] = "The fetus is starting to explore a bit by doing things like opening and closing its fists and mouth. Its knees, elbows and ankles are working, but it’s too soon to feel any kicks. The bones are hardening, but its skin is still see-through. Facial features are more prominent."
        weeks[12] = "All the organs, limbs, bones and muscles are present and will continue to develop in order to become fully functional. The circulatory, digestive and urinary systems are also working and the liver produces bile. The fetus is drinking and peeing amniotic fluid."
        weeks[13] = "Vocal cords form and the fetus’s large head begins to grow proportionate to its body."
        weeks[14] = "The fetus’s skin starts to thicken and fine hair begins to grow. It can start bringing its fingers to its mouth and turn its head. External genitals are fully developed and fingerprints begin to form."
        weeks[15] = "Some organs, like intestines and ears, are moving to their permanent location. The fetus still uses amniotic fluid to practice breathing, but its lungs are beginning to develop. The fetus begins to make more purposeful movements, like sucking its thumb or smiling."
        weeks[16] = "The child has lips and its ears are developed enough that it can hear you talk. Even though its eyes are closed, the child can react to light by turning away from it."
        weeks[17] = "The child still has thin skin, but will start to put on fat. Its skin is covered with a whitish coating called vernix. This “cheesy” substance is thought to protect skin from long-term exposure to amniotic fluid."
        weeks[18] = "The fetus is covered in lanugo, a peach fuzz-like hair. It helps keep the fetus warm and provides another layer of protection. The fetus may have a sleep-wake cycle, and loud noises may wake the fetus if it’s asleep."
        weeks[19] = " The fetus is getting stronger and most people begin to feel kicks and punches. The fetus also has its own unique set of fingerprints and can hiccup."
        weeks[20] = "The fetus’s nails grow towards the end of its fingers. The area of the brain responsible for its five senses begins to develop."
        weeks[21] = "Limb movements are coordinated and frequent. The fetus has bone marrow that helps it produce blood cells."
        weeks[22] = "The fetus’s grasp is getting stronger and it can touch its ears and the umbilical cord. It can hear your heartbeat, your stomach rumble and your breathing."
        weeks[23] = "If born prematurely, the fetus may survive after the 23rd week with intensive care. It will begin rapidly adding fat to its body."
        weeks[24] = "The fetus’s lungs are fully developed, but not well enough to work outside your uterus."
        weeks[25] = "More body fat makes the fetus’s skin less wrinkled and plumper. Its nervous system is quickly maturing."
        weeks[26] = "The fetus makes melanin, the substance that gives skin and eyes their color. The fetus’s lungs start to make surfactant, a substance that helps it breathe after birth."
        weeks[27] = "The fetus can open its eyes and blink. It also has eyelashes."
        weeks[28] = "The fetus may begin turning head-down in your uterus as it gets ready for birth. At the end of the seventh month, the fetus is about 14 to 15 inches long and weighs between 2 and 3 pounds."
        weeks[29] = "You may notice the kicks and jabs feel more like pokes now that the fetus is getting cramped in the amniotic sac."
